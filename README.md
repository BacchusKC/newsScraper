# News Scraper

This is an app that scrapes various sites, by category, and displays titles so they can be skimmed easily, saved and even make comments on them. The app uses:

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

It was designed to show skills in back-end design and was also designed mainly for mobile. It does work on a full size screen, but I feel it looks a little to busy that way. I made it as a convienent way to get your news on the go. Yes, I know reddit is a thing, lol.
