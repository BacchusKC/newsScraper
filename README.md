# [News Scraper](https://bacchus-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

This is an app that scrapes various sites, by category, and displays titles so they can be skimmed easily, saved and even make comments on them. The app uses:

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Express Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

It was designed to show skills in back-end design and was also designed mainly for mobile. It does work on a full size screen, but I feel it looks a little too busy that way. I made it as a convienent way to get your news on the go. Yes, I know reddit is a thing, lol.

To use the app, first choose your category in the dropdown menu, then either look through already scrapped articles or get new ones. You can get new articles with the "Get ..." button and empty old articles with the "Empty ..." button.
